# First Java Program - HelloWorld
Let's walk through a simple HelloWorld program. You must have a JDK intalled in order to do this.
1) Open up your command-line terminal application
2) Check that you have a JDK installed:

```shell
javac -version
# if you get something like "command not found" on your terminal, you don't have the JDK installed
```

3) Create a directory, move to it, and create a file called `HelloWorld.java`

```shell
mkdir java-practice
cd java-practice
touch HelloWorld.java
```

Now open this file with a simple text editor program and write the HelloWorld application.

```java
package com.revature.mypackage;
public class HelloWorld {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```

4) Now that the source code is written, we can compile it into bytecode using the compiler (`javac`):

```shell
javac HelloWorld.java
# Hello, world!
```

You should now see a `HelloWorld.class` file in your directory - this contains the compiled bytecode of the program. If you open it up in a text editor, it will appear as gibberish because the bytecode is not human-readable, it is merely instructions that the JVM can understand and run.

5) Finally we can run the compiled bytecode using the java command

```shell
java HelloWorld
```

This command loads and executes the `HelloWorld.class` file. Note that we do not include the `.class` extension when using the `java` command.
