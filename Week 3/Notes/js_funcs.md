# JavaScript Functions
## Pass by value
In JavaScript, **all function arguments are passed by value**. This means that the value of any variable passed to a function is copied into the argument of the function. **Any changes you make to the argument will not be reflected in the variable outside of the function**.

### Primitives
With primitive values this behavior is straightforward. The **primitive value is copied to a new variable**:

```js
function changeValue(number) {
  console.log(number) // 20
  number = 42
  console.log(number) // 42
}
let myNumber = 20
changeValue(myNumber)
console.log(myNumber) // 20
```

In the above example, we defined a primitive value `myNumber` to be 20. When we passed this variable into the `changeValue` function, it copied the value 20 into the new number variable. When we changed `number` it did not affect `myNumber` because those are two different variables, each with their own value.

### Objects
If you pass an object into a function, the story is slightly different. **The value that is stored in a variable containing an object is not the object itself. Instead, an object reference is being stored inside of that variable.** When you pass a variable containing a reference to an object, **that reference is copied into the arguments of the function**. Since the new variable has a copy of that object reference, we can use this variable to modify the object.

```js
let myObject = {'pet': 'Cat'}
console.log(myObject.pet) // 'Cat'
function adoptDog(obj) {
  obj.pet = 'Dog'
}
adoptDog(myObject)
console.log(myObject.pet) // 'Dog'
```

It is tempting to conclude that objects are pass by reference, because you can modify the object that we pass into the function. However, if we attempt to change the value of the variable by assigning a new object we see that this isn't true:

```js
let myObject = {'pet': 'Cat'}
console.log(myObject.pet) // 'Cat'
function adoptDog(obj) {
  obj = {'pet': 'Dog'}
}
adoptDog(myObject)
console.log(myObject.pet) // 'Cat'
```

**Here, we see that because we reassigned the variable obj to a new object, the value of the variable changed (new reference) and so the value of the variable myObject did not change. JavaScript is pass by value.**

### Function Expression / Anonymous Function
Function Expressions also are known as a named or anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function declared without any identifier refer to it. It is an expression that the variable holds a function. For example: `var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};`

```js
var anon = function() {
  alert('I am anonymous');
};
var prd = function (a, b) {
    return a * b;
};
anon();
alert("prd = " + prd(2,4));
```

The above example results in two alert boxes on the current browser. The first alert box has "I am anonymous" inside it. The second alert box has "prd = 8" inside it.

### Self-Invoking Functions / IIFE Functions
**A self-invoking function is an anonymous function that is invoked immediately after its definition.** It is also known as the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) function. It holds an anonymous function inside a set of parentheses (), which does the execution.

Syntax : `(function(){ code goes here...})();`

```js
(function(){
    // do this right now
    console.log("Look at me, I'm running");
})();
```

### Callback Functions
A callback function is a function that gets **executed after another function completes the execution**. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors. JavaScript runs the code in sequential order (from top to down). If there is a case that code runs after some other execution, which is **not happening in a sequence is called asynchronous programming**.All functions in JavaScript are objects and a JavaScript function can be passed another function as an argument.

A callback function can be created by using the `callback` keyword as the last parameter.

```js
function funcOne(x) { alert("x = " + x); }

function funcTwo(y, callback) {
    callback(y);
}

funcTwo(2, funcOne);
```

In the above example, `funcOne` is the callback function. When `funcTwo(2, funcOne);` is called, `funcTwo` takes in a variable (y) and a function (funcOne). `funcTwo` then passes the variable (y=2) to the function it took in, i.e.` funcOne(2)` is called. Then, issues an alert with x=2 on the current browser.

We can also pass an anonymous functions as a callback function.

```js
function funcTwo(y, callback) {
    callback(y);
    callback(y);
}

functionTwo(10, function(x) { alert("x = " + x); })
```

The above example issues an alert two times, saying x = 10 on the current browser.

### Closures
A **closure is a function that remembers and accesses the variables and arguments of its outer function** even after the function return. The closure is able to access the variables defined between its curly brackets, the outer functionâ€™s variables and the global variables.

```js
function greeting() {
    var message = 'Hi';

    function sayHi() {
        console.log(message);
    }

    return sayHi;
}
let hi = greeting();
hi(); // prints "hi" in the console.
```

Normally, when the `greeting()` function has completed executing, the message variable is no longer accessible. In this case, we execute the `hi()` function that references the `sayHi()` function, the message variable still exists. Hence, the `sayHi()` function is a closure.
