# Referential Integrity

When we create table relationships as mentioned previously, it is important that our data remains in a consistent state throughout the database. For example, we never want a record on our class table to be pointing to a record in either the Teacher or the Student table that does not exist. We call enforcing this property as maintaining **referential integrity**. When we break referential integrity, we will find **orphan records** in the database - these are records whose foreign keys do not point to an existing record in the other table. One way of preventing this from occuring is by using a setting called **CASCADE DELETE** - when we enable this, deleting a record in the table will also cascade that operation and delete any records in tables that reference the that record via foreign keys.
